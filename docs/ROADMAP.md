# Roadmap for Plugin Manager Workspace

This document outlines the roadmap for the Plugin Manager Workspace, detailing its current status, future plans, and key decisions made during development.

## Project Overview

The Plugin Manager Workspace provides a minimal, type-safe plugin pipeline for JavaScript/TypeScript applications. It enables sequential execution of synchronous and asynchronous plugins that transform file collections, making it ideal for content processing, static site generation, and build systems.

## Current Status

### What's Complete ‚úÖ

- **Core Plugin Pipeline**: Complete sequential plugin execution system with TypeScript generics
- **Async/Sync Support**: Unified handling of both synchronous and asynchronous plugins
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces with generic file data types
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with specific error types and causes
- **Logging Integration**: Built-in logging with configurable levels via simple-logger
- **Plugin Lifecycle**: Complete add/clear/run plugin management
- **Functional Design**: Immutable pipeline where plugins return new file collections
- **Development Tooling**: Complete toolchain (tsup, vitest, ESLint, Prettier)
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite covering plugin execution scenarios
- **Documentation System**: Complete API documentation and usage examples

### In Progress üöß

- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluating large file collection processing performance
- **Plugin Composition**: Advanced plugin chaining and dependency management

### Next Steps

- **Plugin Registry**: System for registering and discovering plugins
- **Conditional Execution**: Support for conditional plugin execution based on file types
- **Parallel Processing**: Optional parallel plugin execution for independent operations

## Project Evolution

### Key Decisions Made

- **Generic Design**: Used TypeScript generics to support any file data structure
- **Functional Pipeline**: Chose immutable approach where plugins return new collections
- **Simple Logger Integration**: Used simple-logger for consistent logging across operations
- **Promise-Based API**: Unified async/sync plugin handling through Promise resolution
- **Minimal Configuration**: Focused on essential plugin management without complex config
- **Error Propagation**: Maintained error context through custom PluginManagerError class

### Learnings and Insights

- **Type Flexibility**: Generic approach enables wide variety of use cases beyond file processing
- **Performance Considerations**: Sequential execution ensures predictable order but may impact large datasets
- **Plugin Design**: Functional approach simplifies reasoning about plugin interactions
- **Error Context**: Detailed error information with plugin position helps debugging complex pipelines
- **Logging Necessity**: Plugin execution benefits greatly from detailed logging for pipeline debugging

### Recent Changes

- Implemented comprehensive error handling with PluginManagerErrorType enumeration
- Added plugin validation to ensure only functions are accepted as plugins
- Enhanced logging with trace and info levels for different operation details
- Improved async plugin handling with proper Promise resolution
- Added plugin count tracking and execution progress logging
- Implemented clear plugin functionality for pipeline reset

- PluginManager interface defining public API
- PluginManagerConfig for internal configuration management

### Current Capabilities

- **Generic File Processing**: Support for any file data structure through TypeScript generics
- **Sequential Execution**: Predictable plugin execution order with proper data flow
- **Async/Sync Plugins**: Unified handling of both synchronous and asynchronous plugins
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with plugin position and cause tracking
- **Pipeline Management**: Add, run, and clear plugins with full lifecycle control
- **Logging Control**: Configurable log levels for debugging and monitoring
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with detailed interfaces and error types
