# Documentation

- The `index.md` is automatically synced from the main package [`README.md`](../packages/example-package/README.md) file via GitHub Actions, which serves as the main entry point for usage guides for end users and developers.
- Read the [Project Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for project goals, status, evolution, and development guidelines.
- Read the [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed information on the package architecture, build configuration, and implementation patterns.
- Follow the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines, coding standards, and best practices.
- The `guides/` directory contains student-focused guides to help understand the project setup and development practices. These guides are designed to be educational and provide detailed explanations of selected topics relevant to the project that I believe college students typically are not familiar with.
